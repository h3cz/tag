**Tag** is the chat product inside [Hecz](https://hecz.dev) — a free + Pro multi-model AI chat with persistent memory, BYOK support, and streaming responses.

Hosted version: **[hecz.dev/chat](https://hecz.dev/chat)**

---

## Features

- **Multi-model routing** — Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, and more via a single interface
- **Persistent memory** — conversations remembered across sessions via pgvector + mem0
- **Free + Pro tiers** — generous free limits, Pro unlocks higher rate limits and priority routing
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — use your own API keys for any provider
- **Streaming responses** — real-time token streaming via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Graffiti aesthetic** — Tag's signature animated logo and Editorial Street design

## Security And Privacy

- BYOK keys should stay client-side or in the self-hoster's own infrastructure.
- Do not commit `.env` files, provider keys, Supabase service-role keys, Stripe secrets, or webhook secrets.
- Public examples should use placeholder project refs and placeholder environment variables.
- Self-hosters are responsible for configuring Supabase RLS, auth providers, and deployment secrets correctly.

## Self-Hosting

> Requires: Supabase project, a [synthetic.new](https://synthetic.new) API key (or BYOK provider keys), and Node 22 + pnpm.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a Supabase project and run the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in order.
3. Deploy the Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/` via `supabase functions deploy`.
4. Set environment variables (see `.env.example` in the main Hecz repo).
5. Run `pnpm dev` for local development.

The `synthetic-public-proxy` function handles model routing — you'll need either a `synthetic.new` key or configure direct provider keys in Supabase Vault.

Before publishing a fork, copy `docs/templates/SECURITY.md` from the source monorepo into the public repo root as `SECURITY.md`.
